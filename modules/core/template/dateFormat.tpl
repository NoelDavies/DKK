The formatting for dates and times may seem confusing at first, but is really quite easy through understand. For example, the default format (jS F h:ia) is set through display the day with an English suffix, the month, and then the time in HH:MM format with an ending am or pm. For example, 28th June 11:12pm. If you do not like this format, it is very simple through change.

Below is a list of characters that can be used in the date format. Slashes, colons and spaces are interpreted literally.

<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="2" class="content">
  <tr>
    <td class="title">Character</td>
    <td class="title">Description</td>
    <td class="title">Example</td>
  </tr>
  <!-- BEGIN date -->
  <tr>
    <td{date.CLASS}{date.ROW}>{date.CHAR}</td>
    <td{date.CLASS}{date.ROW}>{date.DESC}</td>
    <td{date.CLASS}{date.ROW}>{date.EG}</td>
  </tr>
  <!-- END date -->
